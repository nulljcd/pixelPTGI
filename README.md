# pixelPTGI
A simple realtime 2d pixel game lighting engine.

## Features
- Made for low resolution pixel games.
- Realtime pathtracing.
- Powerful denoising based on TAA and reSTIR.

## Details
- Completely unbiased, single-pass pathtracing

## Notes
- The shader is the actual application, and doesn't need test.cpp, and is easily portible to other engines like unity or godot.

## test.cpp
- test.cpp file runs on SFML 3, and is only for development.
